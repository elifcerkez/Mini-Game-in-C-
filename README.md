# Mini-Game-in-C-

This is an action-rpg-like game.
In the console, player sees a grid by 20x30 (row x column). In this grid, player’s character starts 
in the first cell, and certain amounts of trees and enemies are located in random cells. Each cell 
are hidden, that means player doesn’t see the enemies or trees. Player only see the cells that are 
next around the him/her or the cells that has been already passed by and make it visible (fog of 
war). Player can see the all of the grid with activating the cheat. Pressing c activate and 
deactivate the cheat. If the cheat is active all the cells in the grid will be visible, otherwise 
all of them will be hidden. Player can move in the grid with using w-a-s-d keys. If there is a tree 
or enemy appear in the path of the player, he/she can’t move to that direction. If the enemy is 
right next to the player, the player can kill the enemy with pressing "h". If all the enemies are 
dead or the player presses "q" game ends.
